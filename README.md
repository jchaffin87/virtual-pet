Dear player, 

Hello, and welcome to VirtualPet! You are about to embark on a journey through an unbelievably realistic simulation of pet ownership, taking the role of the proud new owner of this cute little doggy:

Like, OMG, right?!

Just kidding. None of that is true and how cute your new doggie is is going to have to be left to your imagination. For the unimaginative player, I will include this ASCII artwork of a dog (I think), and maybe that'll help you visualize what we're doing here.

                                 ,:'/   _..._
                                // ( `""-.._.'
                                \| /    6\___
                                |     6      4

                                (_'---'`)
                                / `'---`()

OK, now let's get down to brass tacs. What you're actually looking at here is a project I've been working on this weekend which is, in fact, a vitual pet game and is, in fact, meant to vaguely give you the idea of what it's like to be the owner of a pet dog. Not sure how fun it is, but it does "play", if by "play" you mean it runs correctly and provides an interactive experice to the "player". What it isn't is realisitic, as you (the player) only interact with the doggie by selecting from a number of options displayed on a menu after being alerted to the status of various needs the doggie has. Oh and, you can name the pup too. Nearly forgot that key feature. Whew.

Anyway, it isn't complicated to play and the code probably isn't that sophisticated either, so I don't think too much further explanation is necessary. Check it out and see what you think.

Thanks!

PS
	  See below for a list of features I would like to implement in the future, if you're interested.

A list of features I would like to implement in the future:

-Additional interactions with modified attributes and threshold alerts to do with them.
-More finely-tuned attribute modifiers for a more playable and enjoyable game.
-More humorous and/or snarky dialog (monolog?) in prompts and feedback.
-Multiple foods and games for the "feed" and "play" interactions with different doggy responses for each.
-Random events, including doggy self-sufficiency.
-Player choice of multiple types of pets, all with their own prompts, responses, ect.
-Oculus integration.
